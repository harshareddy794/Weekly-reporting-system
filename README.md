## Introduction
This Project is developed for taking weekly work progress from my team:bar_chart:. A weekly report is nothing but noting what they learnt or done in the whole week. In order to provide everyone with good resources:books: and to keep them motivated a weekly report is mandatory. In that view we developed our own website which makes our work easy. We have depolyed our project at https://achievers-weekly-report.herokuapp.com/
