## Introduction
This Project is developed for taking weekly work progress from my team.A weekly report is nothing but noting what they learnt or done in the whole week. In order to provide everyone with good resources and to keep them motivated a weekly report is mandatory. In that view we developed our own website which makes our work easy. We have depolyed our project at https://achievers-weekly-report.herokuapp.com/
